# Federal AI Hackathon

## Introduction

What’s possible with Data.gov datasets? 
- “How many EVs were sold in Illinois last month?”
- “What were the winning Powerball numbers in New York last year?”
- “What progress have we made in reducing lead in public school drinking water?”

But, Data.gov datasets aren’t created equally. 

So, how do we make data.gov more accessible for people and the AI tools they might use? 

Our answer–
1. Improve query-dataset matching and
2. develop scale to measure the AI-friendliness of Data.gov datasets.


## Features


What does “AI-friendly” even mean? We tested sample datasets against GPT-4o, Command R+, etc. We developed a scale for how we assess this friendliness:
Does the dataset have a data dictionary?
Does the dataset have structured data?
Does the dataset contain structured data? 
Is the dataset a link to an external site?
