# AI Friendliness Scale 

Data.gov datasets are evaluated on a scale from Level 1 (Minimal AI Compatibility) to Level 5 (Optimal AI Compatibility):

### Level 1: Minimal AI Compatibility

Data in non-machine-readable formats (e.g., scanned PDFs)
Lack of structured data
Missing or poor metadata
Inconsistent data representation
Rarely or never updated
Incomplete or small datasets
Little to no documentation
Unclear or restrictive usage rights

### Level 2: Basic AI Compatibility

Data in basic machine-readable formats (e.g., CSV, XML)
Some structure, but may be inconsistent
Basic metadata present
Some inconsistencies in data representation
Infrequent updates
Mostly complete datasets, but may have gaps
Minimal documentation
Clear but somewhat restrictive usage rights

### Level 3: Moderate AI Compatibility

Data in common machine-readable formats (e.g., JSON, SQL dumps)
Consistent structure across the dataset
Comprehensive metadata
Generally consistent data representation
Regular updates (e.g., monthly)
Complete datasets with few gaps
Adequate documentation
Open license with some restrictions

### Level 4: High AI Compatibility

Data in easily parsable, standard formats (e.g., well-formed JSON, CSV with headers)
Well-structured data with clear relationships
Detailed and accurate metadata
Highly consistent data representation
Frequent updates (e.g., weekly)
Comprehensive datasets with minimal gaps
Thorough documentation, including data dictionaries
Open license with minimal restrictions

### Level 5: Optimal AI Compatibility

Data in AI-optimized formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, TFRecord)
Perfectly structured data with explicit relationships
Rich, standardized metadata (e.g., schema.org)
Perfectly consistent data representation
Real-time or daily updates
Complete, comprehensive datasets without gaps
Extensive documentation, including usage examples and API access
Fully open license (e.g., Creative Commons Zero)
How to Use This Scale:

Evaluate each dataset against the factors listed above.
Determine which level best describes the dataset's overall AI friendliness.
Use this score to prioritize datasets for AI applications or to identify areas for improvement in data publishing practices.
